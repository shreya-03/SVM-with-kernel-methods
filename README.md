# SVM-with-kernel-methods
Implement and provide the pseudo code, assumptions made, accuracy results and your observations in
a report format along with the code for the following two tasks.

a) Implement non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, namely, Kernel Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis for UCI Arcene cancer classification data
and another dataset (from UCI or anyother ML dataset listing) that have real vectorial data
representation.

b) Employ SMV classifier (using any standard library) for linear and RBF kernel in the resulting K-
dimensional PCA space (where K=10, 100 for the Arcene data and any two K values of choice for
another dataset) as well as 1-dimensional LDA space and report the classification performance
on validation data for both the datasets.
